Why?
----

Sometimes, usually at work, you have no control over some computer settings. A workstation runs shared services which everyone needs, but inactivity causes network connections to be dropped or sessions to be closed, causing the services to fail. This is getting very annoying for you and your coworkers, but the sysadmin is nowhere to be found or refuses to help you.

If only you had a way to keep the computer awake... but you do now!
Get Mousebot to move the cursor for you. It's totally free!

What language uses extension .au3?
----------------------------------

Mousebot is based on ![AutoIt 3](http://www.autoitscript.com/) but you do not need to install it unless you want to modify this program. Mousebot has been compiled into a stand-alone executable file for ease of use.
